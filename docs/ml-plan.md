# ML plan

Where Dao TFT's on-device AI assistant stands. Claude Code reads this before every AI assistant job and updates it at the end.

## Goal

Let players describe their game in plain words ("level 6, 32 gold, two bows and a sword") and have the
app fill in the game state, then explain the engine's recommendations conversationally. Everything runs
in the player's browser, so there is no per-use cost.

## Project rules

**Core design rule:** the scoring engine is the source of truth. The model only translates: player text
into engine inputs, and engine outputs into plain explanations. It never ranks comps, picks items, or
states game facts from its own knowledge. If a feature would need the model to decide something the
engine decides, stop and raise it.

**Settled choices:**

- Model: Llama 3.2 1B Instruct (see decision log).
- Runtime: WebLLM, `q4f16_1` quantization, reusing WebLLM's prebuilt model library for the base model.
- Fine-tuning teaches behavior and output format, never game facts. Unit, item and augment names come
  from the current snapshot at runtime, because the data refreshes daily.
- The model download is opt-in, with an honest progress indicator. Never start it on page load:
  players use this site alt-tabbed out of live games.
- Inference runs in a Web Worker, never on the main thread.
- Every model output is validated with the app's zod schemas before it touches the store.
- The rule-based quick-bar parser stays as the fallback whenever the model isn't loaded, isn't
  supported, or produces invalid output. It is also the baseline in every eval.

**Project-specific never-dos:**

- Never name a published fine-tune without "Llama" at the start (Llama 3.2 license). Include "Built
  with Llama" attribution where the model is used.

## Steps

| Step | Status |
|---|---|
| 1. Export test: prove a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B loads in WebLLM and keeps its training | In progress |
| 2. Game-state contract: exactly what the model outputs | Not started |
| 3. Data: synthetic generator, plus a hand-written real-world test set | Not started |
| 4. Eval harness and rule-based baseline | Not started |
| 5. Base model with prompting | Not started |
| 6. Fine-tune, error analysis, iterate | Not started |
| 7. App integration: assistant module, then UI | Not started |
| 8. Write-up and model card | Not started |

## Decision log

**2026-11-13: Llama 3.2 1B instead of Qwen3.5 0.8B.** Converting Qwen3.5 0.8B to WebLLM format crashed
(segfault in MLC's weight conversion). Converting the untouched base model crashed the same way, so the
problem was the tooling on Colab (likely Python 3.13 with MLC nightly builds), not the fine-tune. The
merged fine-tune was also saved in a text-only layout (`qwen3_5_text`) that differs from the original
(`qwen3_5`), a second problem to fix if Qwen is revisited. Llama 3.2 1B has a standard architecture and
mature conversion support. The model sits behind one interface, so Qwen can be retried later.

**Earlier: model runs in the browser via WebLLM.** No server costs; the site stays a static deploy.

**Earlier: the engine decides, the model translates.** See core design rule.

## Experiment log

**2026-11-13: Qwen3.5 0.8B export test.** Canary training and Python check passed. Conversion failed
(see decision log).

## Open questions

- Does the Llama export test pass in the browser? If MLC conversion crashes on Colab's Python, run MLC
  from a Python 3.12 environment (set `MLC_PYTHON`).
